Example

To illustrate how Gym-TORAX can be used, we provide an example in which three different 
agents interact with the IterHybridEnv environment. This example is organized into 
three parts:

1. :doc:`a description of the environment <iter_env>`,

2. :doc:`the agents and their control strategies <agents>`,

3. :doc:`the results obtained <results>`.
