Examples
=========

This section presents two example cases of Gym-TORAX:

- :doc:`Physical validation`: reproducing a TORAX reference scenario inside Gym-TORAX
  to confirm the wrapper introduces no discrepancy.

- :doc:`Simple control`: using a simple PI controller to search for a ramp-up strategy 
  that maximizes a reward.

These examples illustrate both the correctness of the implementation and the potential for control design.
